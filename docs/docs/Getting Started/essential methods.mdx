### styling with style method

`style()` method is used to assign styles to dominityElements in bulk

```js
el('div').style({
  backgroundColor: 'red',
  padding: '3rem',
  display: 'flex',
  'background-image': 'url()',
});
```

they take in an object and allows you to style components directly from the js file
you could either use camelCased props or use properties as strings

you can also use style method to get a computed style of an element by using only first argument and providing the property as a string

```js
let buttonColor = Button().style('background-color');
```

however these you cant style psuedo classes so or media queries so it is recommended to use a lightweight css framework that does this classbased
we recommend a 1kb library called synxia <a href='https://synxia.onrender.com'>check it out</a> or just use tailwindcss cdn
