you will have to set up some stuff in the server if u want the site to reload the right route properly on each reload or to access a specific route straight from the url file

this is done by redirecting all request to the same index.html file,
To set up server-side routing so that all requests redirect to the same `index.html` file, you need to configure your server accordingly. This ensures that client-side routing in your single-page application (SPA) works correctly, and users can access specific routes directly via the URL.

Here are the configurations for common server environments:

### Apache

For Apache, you can use an `.htaccess` file to redirect all requests to `index.html`.

Create an `.htaccess` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

### Nginx

For Nginx, you need to edit your server configuration file to redirect all requests to `index.html`.

Edit your Nginx configuration file (usually located at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` or similar) to include the following:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_or_IP;

    root /path/to/your/project;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

### Express.js (Node.js)

For an Express.js server, you can set up a wildcard route to serve `index.html` for all routes.

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install express path
```

Create a `server.js` file with the following content:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Handle all other routes by sending index.html
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Firebase Hosting

For Firebase Hosting, you can configure the `firebase.json` file to rewrite all requests to `index.html`.

Create or update `firebase.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Vercel

For Vercel, you can configure the `vercel.json` file to handle the rewrites.

Create or update `vercel.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
}
```

### Netlify

For Netlify, you can configure `_redirects` file to handle the rewrites.

Create a `_redirects` file in the `public` directory with the following content:

```plaintext
/*    /index.html   200
```

### Conclusion

By setting up the server to redirect all requests to `index.html`, you enable proper handling of routes in your single-page application. This ensures that the client-side routing logic can take over and display the correct content based on the URL, even when the page is refreshed or accessed directly.
